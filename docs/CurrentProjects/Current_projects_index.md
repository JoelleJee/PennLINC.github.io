# Current Projects

These pages provide an overview of the current projects occurring in the lab.  Below is a template that specifies fields each active project should provide. As projects become  more mature they should transition to a GitHub Pages site, as described [here](https://pennlinc.github.io/docs/Contributing/project-documentation/), but this information should be listed on the GitHub pages site as well. For additional information see the [Project Setup Page](https://pennlinc.github.io/docs/LabHome/ProjectSetup/).
