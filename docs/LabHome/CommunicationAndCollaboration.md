# A Note on Communication and Collaboration

All of our work is highly collaborative, and collaboration is oftentimes what makes science fun.  Several basic notes follow below, which of course cannot even scratch the surface of what can both right and wrong in a scientific collaboration.   Please reach out to Ted anytime and suggest updates to this pages as other important situations arise.


### Modes of correspondence

When 


### Slack best practices

For _projects_ use a dedicated project channel for all correspondence.

For general infrastructure / informatics q's, use the #informatics channel on slack or the #pennlinc_general channel.

For cool papers, post to #pennlinc_papers.

For talks, post to #pennlinc_talks and send to Sophia to update the calendar.

For faculty review of manuscripts, grants, or other documents, send to Ted via email.

In general, try to avoid the slack direct message channels for project correspondence, as they are lost and not searchable.   

Finally, remember: if the content of your correspondence is not something you'd want a lot of people to see, strongly consider a phone call rather than a written message.


### Setting priorities & expectations

In general, the biggest constraint we all face is _time_.  As such, one thing that should be addressed in every weekly meeting is the relative priority of different tasks / projects.  This is important to re-assess continuously to make sure they align with scientific impact, career development priorities, and the demands of funded projects.


### Navigating collaborations

A couple general tips follow below.  In general, the rule of thumb is "talk to your faculty supervisor early and often." Specific cases where you should talk to Ted ahead of time include:

1) Starting new collaborations outside the lab.
2) Asking a member of our lab to do something that is likely to be fairly time consuming.
3) Any effort that requires repeated rounds of input / questions to a member of another lab.

Finally, in general it is a good idea to cc Ted on any emails to other faculty outside our section.


### Troubleshooting

In general, the most stressful situations in science often come from inter-personal conflict. Usually this can be resolved with direct and honest communication.  In large collaborative efforts, some degree of mis-communication is inevitable -- and does not reflect anyone "doing something wrong" -- please don't hesitate to reach out to discuss.
